2. Two-bit wide 4-to-1 multiplexer.
   Listing of VHDL architecture from source file `mux_2bit_4to1.vhd `:

   ```vhdl
   architecture Behavioral of mux_2bit_4to1 is
   begin  
       f_o <= a_i when (sel_i = "00") else
              b_i when (sel_i = "01") else
              c_i when (sel_i = "10") else
              d_i;
   ```

   Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file `tb_mux_2bit_4to1.vhd`:

   ```vhdl
   p_stimulus : process

        -- Report a note at the begining of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process started" severity note;

3. A Vivado tutorial. 

   Creating a new project (File - New project):

   ![Creating a new project](Images/vivaldo_new-project.png)

   Then chose Project type *RTL project*. 

   Add source (Create File) and finish the creating process:

   ![Add source while creating a new project](Images/vivaldo_add-source.png)

   Create testbench:

   â€‹	File - Add sources - Add or create simulation sources - Create File

   ![Configuring testbench](Images/vivaldo_add-testbench.png)

   Run simulation:
